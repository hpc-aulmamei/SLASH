 * @brief Owning RAII handle for a mapped BAR region.

 * Encapsulates a @c slash_bar_file containing the BAR mapping (@c map) and
 * length (@c len). Provides typed access via @c getPtr<T>() which brackets
 * memory access with the appropriate @c slash_bar_file_start_* /
 * @c slash_bar_file_end_* calls. Direct raw access is available via
 * @c getRawPtr(), but requires manual bracketing.
 *
 * @warning Not thread-safe. At most one memory operation (read or write)
 *          may be active at a time per @c BarFile instance. Concurrent
 *          calls to @c getPtr() / @c getRawPtr() on the same object are
 *          not allowed.
 *
 * @note Move-only; copying is disabled. The moved-from object is closed.
