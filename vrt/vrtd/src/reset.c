/**
 * @file reset.c
 * @brief Device reset sequence for AMD Alveo V80 using AMI + PCIe Secondary Bus Reset.
 *
 * This module implements the full reset-and-reconfiguration sequence for a
 * SLASH FPGA device.  The sequence combines two mechanisms:
 *
 *   1. AMI (Alveo Management Interface) -- a firmware-level management
 *      interface exposed through the AVED (Alveo Versal Example Design)
 *      driver on PF0.  AMI provides ioctls for device management operations
 *      such as programming boot partitions and triggering firmware-level
 *      reconfiguration.
 *      TODO(vserbu): explain AMI protocol details
 *
 *   2. PCIe hotplug via the SLASH kernel module -- after the firmware has been
 *      told to reconfigure, the PCIe device must be removed from the bus,
 *      a Secondary Bus Reset (SBR) must be toggled on the upstream bridge,
 *      and the bus must be rescanned so the newly-configured device is
 *      re-enumerated by the kernel.
 *
 * Multi-PF handling
 * -----------------
 * The Alveo V80 exposes three PCIe Physical Functions (PFs) under the same
 * bus:device address:
 *
 *   - PF0: AVED/AMI management function (used for firmware ioctls)
 *   - PF1: QDMA function (used for DMA data transfers)
 *   - PF2: Additional function
 *   TODO(vserbu): clarify PF2 role (CMC? user PF?)
 *
 * Before performing a Secondary Bus Reset, ALL three PFs must be removed from
 * the Linux PCI subsystem.  If any PF is left attached while the SBR is
 * toggled, the kernel may attempt to access a device whose configuration
 * space is no longer valid, leading to machine checks or hangs.  After the
 * SBR and a settling delay, a PCI bus rescan brings all three functions back.
 *
 * Reset sequence (step by step)
 * -----------------------------
 *   1. Compute BDF strings for PF0, PF1, PF2 from the device's BDF.
 *   2. Remove the device from vrtd's tracked device list (it is about to
 *      disappear from the bus).
 *   3. Open the AMI device on PF0, request access.
 *   4. Issue AMI_IOC_DEVICE_BOOT ioctl to tell the AMC firmware to boot
 *      from partition 1 on the next reset.
 *   5. Write a trigger value to BAR0 offset 0x1040000 to initiate the
 *      firmware-level reconfiguration.
 *      TODO(vserbu): explain what BAR0 register 0x1040000 controls in AMI
 *   6. Close the AMI device handle.
 *   7. Remove PF0, PF1, PF2 from the PCI bus via slash_hotplug_remove().
 *      ENODEV is tolerated (device may already have been removed by firmware).
 *   8. Toggle Secondary Bus Reset on the upstream PCIe bridge via
 *      slash_hotplug_toggle_sbr().
 *   9. Wait 5 seconds for the device to complete reconfiguration and
 *      re-train the PCIe link.
 *  10. Rescan the PCI bus via slash_hotplug_rescan() to re-enumerate all PFs.
 *  11. Verify the device is back by calling ami_dev_find() on PF0.
 *  12. Run device discovery to re-add the reset device to vrtd's tracked
 *      device list.

    /*
     * Step 4: Issue AMI_IOC_DEVICE_BOOT ioctl to select boot partition 1.
     *
     * We issue AMI_IOC_DEVICE_BOOT directly rather than calling
     * ami_prog_device_boot(), even though the latter is the intended public
     * API for this operation.  The reason is that ami_prog_device_boot()
     * unconditionally calls ami_dev_hot_reset() after the ioctl succeeds.
     * ami_dev_hot_reset() performs its own full remove-device / toggle-SBR /
     * rescan cycle by opening the PCIe bridge config-space sysfs file
     * (/sys/bus/pci/devices/<port>/config) with O_RDWR.  That file is mode
     * 0600 and owned by root; vrtd runs as the unprivileged 'vrtd' user, so
     * the open always fails with EBADF regardless of any Linux capabilities
     * granted to the process.
     *
     * More fundamentally, even if the open succeeded, ami_dev_hot_reset would
     * conflict with vrtd's own hotplug reset sequence that follows immediately
     * below.  vrtd drives hotplug through the slash kernel module
     * (slash_hotplug_remove / slash_hotplug_toggle_sbr / slash_hotplug_rescan),
     * which is the authoritative hotplug path for SLASH devices.  Letting both
     * ami_dev_hot_reset and the slash hotplug sequence run would reset the
     * device twice and leave the AMI device handle in an inconsistent state.
     *
     * The correct behaviour is to issue only the AMI_IOC_DEVICE_BOOT ioctl to
     * inform the AMC firmware of the desired boot partition, then hand control
     * back to vrtd to drive the full hotplug sequence itself.  We set
     * cap_override from the device handle (populated earlier by
     * ami_dev_request_access) so that the kernel driver's per-ioctl permission
     * check passes for the unprivileged vrtd user.  CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE granted
     * via AmbientCapabilities in vrtd.service provides an additional fallback
     * that satisfies the IS_ROOT_USER() check in the driver independently of
     * cap_override.
