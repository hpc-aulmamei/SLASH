/**
 * @file dgraph.hpp
 * @brief DGraph — per-device compiled subgraph produced by GraphCompiler.
 *
 * A DGraph is the output of the compilation step for a single device.  It
 * contains:
 *  - The ordered list of `CompiledNode`s assigned to that device.
 *    Bridge-synthesised ops are spliced inline among compiled kernels by the
 *    compiler.
 *  - Optional child DGraph groups owned by parent-level compiled control nodes.
 *    Device runtimes use these groups to execute nested loop bodies and
 *    conditional branches once structured control-flow execution is enabled.
 *  - A pointer to the IDevice responsible for executing the subgraph.
 *
 * DGraph is an internal compiler artifact; it is not part of the user-facing API.
