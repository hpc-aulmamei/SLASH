# Flash a V80 board with a PDI over JTAG via xsdb.
#
# The board normally boots from flash (OSPI), so a JTAG "device program" only
# takes effect if PMC ROM is first told (via CRP.BOOT_MODE_USER at
# 0xF1260200) to wait for a JTAG-supplied image instead of reading the
# physical boot-mode strap pins. This script:
#
#   1. Forces JTAG boot mode and PMC-resets so PMC ROM re-enters waiting for
#      JTAG (same registers as
#      submodules/AVED/hw/*/scripts/versal_change_boot_mode.tcl).
#   2. Programs the PDI over the JTAG debug interface.
#   3. Leaves the boot-mode override set on success, so the board continues
#      to run from the JTAG-loaded image for the rest of the test.
#      Tests that use this flow must avoid AMI-triggered resets unless they
#      also re-run this JTAG programming step afterward.
#
# PDI_PATH must point to a JTAG-bootable boot PDI (boot header at offset 0),
# not a flash image. In particular the SLASH static-shell PDI
# (amd_v80_gen5x8_25.1.pdi) has a 32 KiB FPT prepended for OSPI boot-search and
# must have that header stripped before use here, or the PMC ROM rejects it
# with "ROM failed to handle config data" (ROM State 0xA).
#
# Usage:
#   PDI_PATH=/path/to/boot.pdi xsdb versal_flash_pdi.tcl

# Steps 1-2 are wrapped in catch so failure can restore the boot-mode override.

# restoring is safer because a half-programmed board left in JTAG boot mode
# would strand PMC ROM waiting for a debugger on later resets.
