   * - graph/00
     - multi_image_pipeline
     - End-to-end CPU + FPGA graph with two exclusive-image vbins, one-call
       FPGA bring-up, chained reprogram nodes, an in-place CPU kernel, and a
       fixed-count loop carrying state.
   * - graph/01
     - edge_detection
     - Basic Graph API authoring: CPU/FPGA kernels, buffers, scalars, and a
       single reprogram gating three kernels in one vbin image.
   * - graph/02
     - sharpen_loop
     - Loops and conditionals: a fixed-count FPGA loop carrying state, running
       alongside a CPU reduction, followed by a post-loop conditional.

Each example includes a ``CMakeLists.txt`` with targets for hardware (``hw``), emulation (``emu``),
and simulation (``sim``) flows. See ``examples/README.md`` in the repository for build
instructions.
